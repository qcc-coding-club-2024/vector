Hello, 

As I said, I am now uploading this readme file that will indicate how to install the tools to use in this project.

The first thing to know is that we need a virtual machine that we can use as not to modify our actual system.

This means that every change we will make will be inside a virtual machine (that is, a simulated computer). So, even if we make mistakes that won't affect your Windows operating system or your MacOS system.

You can find the installer for Virtual Box here:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

I encourage you to use a Windows machine to do this since my knowledge about MacOS systems is very limited.
In case that you only have a MacOS computer, bring it to the club sessions and we will find a way to install VirtualBox and have it running for you to be able to code within the virtual machine.
